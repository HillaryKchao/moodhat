# Introduction

The EEG Mood Hat is an EEG visualizer project that works with the Muse to stream, process, and visualize the user EEG data. It is only currently equipped with capabilities for LSL streaming.

In the testing directory, there are two tests: one testing the pipe, and one testing the PSD processing block.

Upload Excel files of EEG data collected by the Muse to the current working directory.
